# THE CAT & THE MOUSE COMIC

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Our project consists on a comic and interactive game about a cat and a mouse. When the user enters the comic, they are presented with an opening page. When the user clicks the start button, they are directed to the next panel, which is set in a bedroom. The user must click the object in which they believe the mouse is hiding in. if they user chooses the wrong option, they are directed to a page in which they are presented the option to try again. The user can try again and make through the entire comic. The experience we are striving to create is an interactive and fun comic, in which the user is able to have control on how the story progresses. If the user clicks the correct item. the story will progress. If not, the user must try again. We are aiming to make the user feel involved in the story, and apart of the comic. There is a plot twist at the end, which we hope will surprise the user and create a "happy ending". 

## PROCESS 

Our group decided to split the woek amongst outselves. Vladmir and Zion worked in the code, while Hind and Raya worked on the viduals. 

## REFLECTION 

While our initial idea was to create a comic story revolving around the 9 lives of a cat, the idea was too complex and exceeded the 6 panel limit. Therefore, we decided to have a cat and mouse story. The overall comic was what we expected, and met our goals, as it was interactive and told a story.
